# BSc-Thesis-Telemedicine-Stethoscope

## Overview
This **Bachelor Thesis (A*)** presents the design, development, and implementation of the **Telemedicine Stethoscope System** ‚Äì a novel solution aimed at improving remote auscultation in telemedicine. The system enables doctors to listen to a patient's heart and lung sounds in real-time while accurately positioning the stethoscope on the patient's body remotely.

## Design

### System Overview

The Telemedicine Stethoscope System is composed of three primary subsystems:

1. **Real-time Streaming**  
Handles the real-time transmission of heart and lung sounds from the patient to the doctor with minimal latency.

2. **Pose Detection and Point Selection Tracking**  
Allows the doctor to accurately select a point on the patient‚Äôs chest for stethoscope placement by analyzing the patient‚Äôs pose.

3. **Locating the Stethoscope Location**  
Uses robotic arm assistance to automatically move the stethoscope to the selected position on the patient‚Äôs body.

### Component Design

#### 1. Live Streaming Subsystem

The live streaming subsystem enables a continuous video/audio connection between the patient and the doctor.
- **Client-side Interface:**  
Built using the Angular framework (HTML, CSS, and TypeScript) to create a dynamic and user-friendly interface.
  
- **Server-side Operations:**  
Implemented with Node.js, hosted on Heroku to handle backend operations and ensure smooth communication with the frontend.

- **Deployment:**  
The application is deployed on Firebase Hosting for seamless web access and scalability.

- **Workflow:**  
Peer-to-peer communication is established using WebRTC, and Socket.io enhances signaling. This workflow is shown in the diagram below.

#### 2. Pose Detection and Point Selection Tracking Subsystem

This subsystem allows the doctor to precisely select the location for stethoscope placement on the patient's chest.

- **Pose Estimation Model:**  
TensorFlow.js, in combination with the MoveNet model, is used for real-time estimation of the patient‚Äôs body pose. The system detects keypoints (e.g., shoulders) to determine the optimal chest area.

- **Tracked Point Selection:**  
During the video call, the doctor can click on the video stream to select the auscultation point. The system highlights this point with a red dot (stethoscope icon) and stores the coordinates in Firebase Realtime Database.

Algorithm 1: Pose Detection and Point Selection Tracking Subsystem

Require: Video frame I
Ensure: Detected pose P and tracked point T
1. Load the MoveNet model
2. Define input parameters (e.g., image resolution, pose classes)
3. Pass I to the MoveNet model: P = MoveNet(I)
4. Identify the chest area based on key body part locations in P
5. Store coordinates of the chest area as T in the Real-time Database
6. Return P, T

#### 3. Locating the Stethoscope Subsystem

This subsystem ensures the stethoscope is accurately positioned on the patient‚Äôs body with the help of a robotic arm.

1. **User Interface for Caregiver:**  
The caregiver can manually place the stethoscope by referring to the live video feed and the selected point, marked with a red dot on the UI.


2. **Robotic Arm Assistance:**  
The system uses a **Dobot Robotic Arm** that receives coordinates from Firebase and moves the stethoscope to the specified location with high precision. The robotic arm uses inverse kinematics to determine the necessary joint angles based on the target coordinates:
   \[
   \theta = f_{\text{inv}}(X)
   \]
   
   where:
   - \( \theta \) represents the joint angles,
   - \( X \) is the target position (x and y coordinates),
   - \( f_{\text{inv}} \) denotes the inverse kinematics function.

A demonstration video of the robotic arm's movement is available below:

1. Digital Stethoscope - Thinklabs One
2. Audio Splitter and Cable
3. Sound Blaster USB
4. Headphones
5. ThinkLink
